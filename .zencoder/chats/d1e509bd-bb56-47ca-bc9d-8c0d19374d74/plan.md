# Fix bug

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Investigation and Planning

Analyze the bug report and design a solution.

1. Review the bug description, error messages, and logs [x]
2. Clarify reproduction steps with the user if unclear [x]
3. Check existing tests for clues about expected behavior [x]
4. Locate relevant code sections and identify root cause [x]
5. Propose a fix based on the investigation [x]
6. Consider edge cases and potential side effects [x]

Save findings to `c:\Users\AGYIRI SAKYI\Desktop\kingshms\.zencoder\chats\d1e509bd-bb56-47ca-bc9d-8c0d19374d74/investigation.md` with:

- Bug summary [x]
- Root cause analysis [x]
- Affected components [x]
- Proposed solution [x]

### [ ] Step: Implementation

Read `c:\Users\AGYIRI SAKYI\Desktop\kingshms\.zencoder\chats\d1e509bd-bb56-47ca-bc9d-8c0d19374d74/investigation.md`
Implement the bug fix.

1. Add/adjust regression test(s) that fail before the fix and pass after
2. Implement the fix
3. Run relevant tests
4. Update `c:\Users\AGYIRI SAKYI\Desktop\kingshms\.zencoder\chats\d1e509bd-bb56-47ca-bc9d-8c0d19374d74/investigation.md` with implementation notes and test results

If blocked or uncertain, ask the user for direction.
